description: |
  Perform a search request. The search request is performed either synchronously, meaning the request hangs until the
  search has completed, or asynchronously, meaning the request returns immediately, which is determined by the `async`
  request parameter. If the search request completes successfully, as determined by the `status` property, the search
  results are returned in the response body.
