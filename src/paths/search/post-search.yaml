  Perform a search request.

  The search request is performed either synchronously, meaning the request hangs until the
  search has completed, or asynchronously, meaning the request returns immediately, which is determined by the `async`
  request parameter.

  If the search request completes successfully, as determined by the `status` property, the search
  results are returned in the response body.

  Synchronous requests wait for a maximum of 100 seconds for the search to
  complete, until which point the response is returned as if it was an asynchronous request.
