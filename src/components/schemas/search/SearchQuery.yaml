      - question: Do broad beans need to be dried before planting?
        answer_excerpt: |
          Next to potatoes, broad beans are one of the easiest staples to grow. Dried broad beans, or fava beans, are
          simply beans left in the pod until they rattle. When you've had your fill of fresh, leave the rest on the
          plant to dry. If it's wet, haul the pods indoors, to shell and dry somewhere warm.
