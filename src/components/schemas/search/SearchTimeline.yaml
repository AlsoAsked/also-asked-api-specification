  volatility:
    type: number
    format: float
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 1
    description: |
      The volatility score of the search timeline entry. The volatility is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates
      no change and 1 indicates a complete change.
      The volatility score is divided in 2, where 0.5 represents the volatility of the first level of the hierarchy and
      0.5 represents the volatility of the second level of the hierarchy.
      For example, if the previous search returned 4 first level questions and 16 second level questions, and the
      current search replaced 2 first level questions and 8 second level questions, the volatility score would be
      0.5.
      If the previous search returned 4 first level questions and 16 second level questions, and the current search
      replaced 4 first level questions and 16 second level questions, the volatility score would be 1.
      If no changes were made to the search timeline, the volatility score would be 0.
    example: 0.25
