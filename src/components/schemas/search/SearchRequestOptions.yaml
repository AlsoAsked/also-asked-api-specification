title: Search Request Options
type: object
description: |
  The search request object is used to specify the search criteria for a search request.
properties:
  terms:
    type: array
    description: |
      The terms to search for.
    items:
      type: string
      description: |
        The term to search for.
      minLength: 1
      maxLength: 4127
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 1000
    uniqueItems: true
    example:
      - When to plant out broad beans?
      - How to grow broad beans?
      - When to harvest broad beans?
  language:
    type: string
    description: |
      The language to use when searching for the terms.
    enum:
      $ref: ../../../enums/Language.yaml
    example: en
    default: en
  region:
    type: string
    description: |
      The region code used when performing a search. The region code is a two-letter ISO 3166-1 code.
    enum:
      $ref: ../../../enums/Region.yaml
    example: us
    default: us
  depth:
    type: integer
    format: int32
    description: |
      The depth of the search determines the number of hierarchical levels of questions returned in the results.
      A greater depth value retrieves questions nested within additional layers of subquestions. Be aware that
      increasing the depth will increase the number of credits consumed. A search depth of 2 will consume 1 credit,
      whereas a depth of 3 will consume 4 credits.
    example: 2
    default: 2
    minimum: 2
    maximum: 3
  fresh:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The fresh flag determines whether the search results are retrieved from the cache or live from the search engine.
    example: false
    default: false
  async:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The async flag determines whether to run the search in a blocking (synchronous) or non-blocking (asynchronous)
      manner. When a search request is performed asynchronously, the webhooks configured for the account will be
      notified when the status of a search changes. When a search is synchronous, the search results are returned in
      the response body when the search is complete.
    example: false
    default: false
  notify_webhooks:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The notify webhooks flag determines whether to notify webhooks when the status of a search changes. Webhooks are
      notified regardless of whether the search is performed synchronously or asynchronously. Use this flag to disable
      webhook notifications for synchronous searches which do not require webhook notifications.
    example: true
    default: true
required:
  - terms
