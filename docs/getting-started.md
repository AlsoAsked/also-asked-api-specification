## Overview

The **AlsoAsked API** offers developers access to 'People Also Ask' search results. This API provides insights into
frequently asked questions related to specific search queries.

## Features

With the **AlsoAsked API**, you can:

- Conduct synchronous (waiting for completion) or asynchronous (immediate return with ID; updates via webhooks)
  searches.
- Retrieve search results.
- View your past search history.
- Use webhooks to receive updates on search status, from start to completion or any failures.
- Access account details, including the count of remaining credits.

## Requirements

A **Pro subscription** is necessary to use the live API. For developers in the initial stages, our sandbox API
provides a testing environment without returning actual 'People Also Ask' results. This allows for development and
testing before committing to a **Pro subscription**.

For more on the **Pro subscription**, visit our [pricing page](https://alsoasked.com/pricing).

## Documentation

The documentation for the API is available in the sidebar on the left. The documentation is generated from the OpenAPI specification, which is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlsoAsked/also-asked-api-specification/blob/main/openapi/openapi.yaml).

The documentation is split into two sections, articles and reference. The articles section contains guides and tutorials for using the API, while the reference section contains detailed information about the API endpoints, as well as the ability to try out the API directly from the documentation.
